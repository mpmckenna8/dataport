Exciting time as there are a lot of announcements on new Data portals and 'open government' and even APIs to make it really simple for developers to use that data in their apps.

Sadly, many posted data sets are simply the base data for visualizations which already aggregated and often processed the raw data I thought I was going to find.  

Case in point many datasets on Socrata are not accionable datasets but just already aggregated data used to make a visualization.
